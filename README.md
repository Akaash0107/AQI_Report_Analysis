## Air_Quality_Index_(AQI)_Across_Cities
Welcome to the Air_Quality_Index_(AQI)_Across_Cities_2024 repository!
This project focuses on analyzing the air quality of various cities through a dashboard visualization, offering deep insights into pollution trends and environmental health.

## Project Objective
The goal is to provide a detailed analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) across multiple cities in 2024.
This dashboard helps understand pollution patterns, the most and least polluted areas, and seasonal variations, supporting better environmental decisions.

## Acknowledgment
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data visualization and dashboard creation, especially related to environmental data.
Special thanks to the online community and resources that guided me throughout the project journey.

## Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook
Python (Pandas, Numpy)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Project Structure
1. Raw Data
Air_Quality_Data_2020-2024.xlsx: Contains AQI records collected from various Indian cities over the years, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and other pollutants.

2. Dashboard
Air_Quality_Index_Across_Cities_2024.png: The final visualization showing AQI distribution, top/bottom cities, and trends.

Questions (KPIs)
Which city has the worst air quality in 2024?

Which city has the best air quality?

What is the average AQI across all cities?

Which months recorded the highest pollution levels?

Which pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, etc.) contributed most to the AQI?

How does AQI trend vary seasonally across cities?

Top 5 most polluted and least polluted cities.

Process
Understanding Business Problem: Addressing the need to monitor and visualize air quality trends across cities.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected anomalies, and standardized city names.

Data Processing: Aggregated monthly and yearly AQI data to identify patterns.

Data Analysis: Calculated averages, rankings, and seasonal variations.

Data Visualization: Designed a clean, interactive dashboard using Excel for easy interpretation.

Insights or Results: Final output is an insightful dashboard with key environmental indicators.

Sample Insight
ðŸŒ† Most Polluted City: Delhi reported the highest AQI levels consistently across multiple months.

ðŸŒ¿ Cleanest City: Shimla and Kochi recorded the lowest average AQI levels, indicating cleaner air.

ðŸ“… Seasonal Trends: Pollution peaked during the winter months (November-December) due to low wind speeds and stubble burning.

ðŸ§ª Dominant Pollutants: PM2.5 and PM10 were the primary pollutants contributing to poor air quality.

ðŸ“Š City-wise Analysis: Northern cities showed significantly higher AQI levels compared to southern cities.

Conclusion & Recommendations
To improve air quality:

Increase green cover in highly polluted cities through urban forestry programs.

Implement stricter emission control policies during peak winter months.

Promote public transport and discourage private vehicle use in cities with high AQI.

Conduct regular pollution awareness campaigns focusing on PM2.5 and PM10 impacts.

Encourage industries to adopt cleaner technologies to reduce emissions.
